# Development & Contributing

The development version can be installed with [Poetry], a Python dependency manager
that provides dependency isolation, reproducibility, and streamlined packaging to PyPI.
Filetote currently support Poetry `v1.8`.

Testing and linting is performed with [Tox] (`v4.12`+).

[Poetry]: https://python-poetry.org/
[Tox]: https://tox.wiki/

It is also highly recommended to [install `pre-commit`], which will help automatically
lint before committing.

Filetote currently supports Python `3.8`+, which aligns with the most recent version of
beets (`v2.2.0`).

For general information of working with Beets plugins, see the Beets documumentation
[For Developers]

**1. Install Poetry & Tox:**

```sh
python3 -m pip install poetry tox
```

**2. Clone the repository and install the plugin:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gtronset/beets-filetote.git
cd beets-filetote
poetry install
```

**3. Update the config.yaml to utilize the plugin:**

```yaml
pluginpath:
  - /path/to.../beets-filetote/beetsplug
```

**4. Run or test with Poetry (and Tox):**

Run beets with the following to locally develop:

```sh
poetry run beet
```

Testing can be run with Tox, ex.:

```sh
poetry run tox -e 3.13
```

For other linting environments, see `pyproject.toml`. Ex: `lint` (courtesy of `ruff`):

```sh
poetry run tox -e lint
```

Ex: `format` (courtesy of `ruff`):

```sh
poetry run tox -e format
```

Running `poetry run` before every command can be tedious. Instead, you can activate the
virtual environment in your shell with:

```sh
poetry shell
```

Configuration of Tox follows [Poetry's recommended strategy #2], which allows Poetry
to manage dependencies but still allow Tox to manage a distinct environment. Test for
all supported Python versions can be run with the base `tox` command, and can be run in
parallel via `tox -p`, i.e.:

```sh
poetry run tox -p
```

**Docker:**

A Docker Compose configuration is available for running the plugin in a controlled
environment. Running the `compose.yaml` file for details.
